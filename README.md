# Comparative Study of different CNN Architectures

Traffic Signs are easy to identify for humans. However for computer systems, its a challenging problem. Traffic Sign Classification is the process of automatically recognizing traffic signs along the road. In this report, the performance of different CNN architectures for Traffic sign classification is analyzed against datasets of varying classes and samples. Effects of different hyperparameters on model performance and its convergence is also studied. The trained models are evaluated using different performance metrics and a comprehensive comparison report is being generated. Careful consideration was given on the choice of datasets for the study to make sure they can represent signs of varied variety and real-world distortions and weather conditions.
